            The markers below indicate where BoumWave will automatically insert your blog post links.
            When you run "bw generate", all posts will be listed here, sorted by date (most recent first).
            Everything between these markers will be regenerated automatically - don't edit this zone manually!

            You can customize the appearance of each post link by editing the link_template in your templates/ folder.
            The markers themselves are configurable in your boumwave.toml file (posts_start_marker and posts_end_marker).
